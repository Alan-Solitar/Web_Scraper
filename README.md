# Web_Scraper
This is a python web scraper to download files from an rss feed 
Everything is generalized and is for educational purposes.
If you want to play around with this, you need to remove the dummy link in the main file with a real one.
You also need to replace the console command in the downloader to decide what is done with your files
after they have been retrieved.
